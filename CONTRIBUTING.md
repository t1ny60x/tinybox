Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tinybox!

We are still in very early stage of development, you can checkout a list of [issues](https://github.com/junzhengca/tinybox/issues). Once you are ready to work on one of them, contact the maintainer so you can be assigned.

Generally speaking, you should aim for good test coverage when submitting features. This means unit tests for utility packages, and integration tests for JSON RPC handlers.
